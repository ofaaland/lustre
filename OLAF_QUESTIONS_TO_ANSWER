olaf questions to answer

User interface:
1. What is desired behavior for "match" with YAML including "global"?
"global" contains a list of several global settings. What, if anything,
should we do to global values _NOT_ mentioned?  Ideas:
1. Set them to default values, if they aren't already.  This seems most
consistent with the idea of match (AKA reconcile) - make the system look like
what is in YAML
2. Leave them unchanged
